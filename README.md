<hr>

<p style="text-align: center;">Coffeebar D'ici was a startup company in Terneuzen Netherlands in 2020, based around serving people coffee from countries such as Brazil and Italy. Unfortunately, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the business never came off the ground. The website itself was already built and almost ready for production.</p>


<h3>My personal view on the experience</h3>
<p>The project, on the other hand, was still a good experience I earned, especially, because I have been writing JavaScript for the first time as well.
The JavaScript I wrote, can be found on the 'coffee-producing countries' page, where the several containers had to be given their right measurements (which was dependant on the amount of content there was for that specific country).</p>
